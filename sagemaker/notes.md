Intent:  Improve the process of ML modeling, by providing Build, Train, and Deploy modules:


* Build:
  * hosted Jupyter notebooks
  * allow connecting directly to data in S3
  * set of "built-in", performance optimized ML algorithms
  * pre-configured to run TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, and Chainer
     * allow local mode script testing via Python SDK
  * allow using custom ML framework
  
* Train
  * simplify training proces by managing infrastructure and scaling
  * automatic model tuning
  
* Deploy
  * real-time or batch prediction support
  * auto-scaling
  * A/B testing support
